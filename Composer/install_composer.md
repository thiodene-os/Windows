# Install Composer on Windows 10
## Requires a prior PHP 7 Installation
See the PHP for Windows installation doc
Next, we're going to install Composer by downloading it and moving it into place so we can run it with just the composer command:
- Download the Windows Installer for Composer and run it.
Source: https://getcomposer.org/download/
- Note that the Windows Installer for Composer might ask to make changes to your php.ini file
Allow it!
- Close out of any open PowerShell or other terminal windows, and then open a new one.
- Run the composer command, and verify you get a listing of the Composer help and available commands.
- Now you have PHP 7 and Composer running natively on your Windows 10 PC.
