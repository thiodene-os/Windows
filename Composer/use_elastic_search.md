## Source: 
https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-elasticsearch-in-php/

## Run the command to use ElasticSearch
composer require elasticsearch/elasticsearch

## Create a PHP file using ES Client:
Next, letâ€™s create a new php file that we will use for testing and with the following code so that we can use the Elasticsearch client.

require '../../../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;
$client = ClientBuilder::create()->setHosts(['127.0.0.1:9200'])->build();
